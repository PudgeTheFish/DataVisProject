# DataVisProject
This project visualizes trends in social media app use accross different demographics and behaviors. We pulled data from the Pew Core Trends survey from the years 2018 and 2019.

The functions.js is the main file containing the javascript code and rendering of the webpage. There is also an index.css file for some additional styling. Data_2018.json and Data_2019.json contain the data in json format.

The data being rendered was designed to be as modular as possible to allow for easy addition of multiple filters. There are several calls to helper functions with parameters being passed, such as createSocialArr().
